Customer Segmentation: Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to segment customers based on behavior and purchase patterns.
Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate customer segments.
Insights and Recommendations: Analyze characteristics of each segment and provide insights.
